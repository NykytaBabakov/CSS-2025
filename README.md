### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes over 3 million Reddit posts from mental health and COVID-19 specific communities to understand how the onset of the pandemic altered online social behavior. 

Using **Natural Language Processing (TextBlob)** and temporal data analysis, we identified a shift from personal storytelling to "emotional numbness" and news consumption during the early months of 2020.

**Key Insights:**
1.  **The "Shock" Phase:** Activity spikes correlated with global lockdowns (March 2020).
2.  **Emotional Burnout:** A significant decline in linguistic subjectivity and emotional tone.
3.  **Engagement Paradox:** Objective facts were ignored; the community rewarded highly subjective, emotional content.
